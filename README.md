# GAN-Mnist

Here we have generated mnist numeric data using GANs.

A generative adversarial network is a class of machine learning frameworks invented by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. Two neural networks contest with each other in a game. Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set. - Wikipedia

## What are GANs?

In brief in a gan we have 2 networks, a generator that generates new Data and a discriminator that discriminates the generated data as real or fake. The goal is to generate fake/computed data that cannot be distinguished from real data.
